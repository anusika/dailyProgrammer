Challenges from r/dailyprogrammer   

I've been wanting to work with a language besides Python for a while now.  
I learned the basics of data structures and alogrithms in C but I want to expand my horizens a smidge and try C++.  
The goal is to work through some Easy challanges first to build up familiarity with syntax and get a "feel" for what I can do in C++. 
Then eventually move on to some Intermediate/Hard challanges later.

# Completed Challenges

* ![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `378` [The Havel-Hakimi Algorithm](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/bqy1cf/20190520_challenge_378_easy_the_havelhakimi/)
  * Having always struggled with recursion style questions, this challange seemed like the perfect soft way of facing my fear :)
  * The step-by-step warm up functions made it easy to focus on understanding how to build up and implement the algorithm from scratch
  * Main Things I Learned About:
      * How to work with C++ vectors (remove elements, edit elements)
      * Implement a recursive function
      * The benefits of passing a vaiable by reference
